Some primitives:
* Packet loss primitive
* Link failure primitive
* switch failure primitive
* adversarial UDP flow primitive

Some scenarios (culled from the Everflow paper):
=================================
* Unequal load balancing split due to ECMP
* Packet drops in a TCP connection
* Loops in routing
* RDMA pauses
* Occasional latency spikes
* Add our own performance related anamolies

The general workflow is: use chaos monkey primitive to create chaos scenario,
use needlstk to debug scenario, and pin point root cause.

Each chaous monkey is a sequence of calls to chaos monkey primitives that
results in the chaos scenario.

A debug session is a sequence of needlstk queries to drill down to the problem.
