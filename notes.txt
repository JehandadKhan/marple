TODOS

simplifying code
* merge define-before-use with if-conversion pass
* simplify ternary threeopstmts. e.g., z = true ? x : y ==> z = x
* change code generated for map to 'functional' semantics?
* make predicates "smart", e.g., AugPred(true).and(X) == X
* current map & fold validity statements create dead code if operand is invalid
* bug in compiler define-before-use pass: delta=5 unconditionally throws error!
  - when there is a new variable, it may be defined & followed up with 
* remove `_` at beginning of identifiers; make compiler-defined variables start
  with `_` instead
* cleanup code: add @Override annotation to new antlr visitor passes!

additional compiler passes
* pass: ensure fold, map and filter arguments make sense from stage to stage
  - each toplevel query has unique field names --> overwrite if reused
* pass: combine with located expr tree to only install on specific switches
* pass: rules needed to generate outputs for query. By default, assume each
  stage is some intermediate stage; generate output code only for toplevel.

printing p4 code from IRs
* emitting three operand code in p4: variables prefixed by types (e.g.,
  "metadata", "packet", "register", etc.)
* emits should load state on to packets

possible error handling for aggregate functions
* warn if no code path changes the state variables
* warn if predicates are used
* print code line numbers in errors. e.g., see define before use error msgs
* better formatting for error messages

cleaning up the template
* set defaultValue for aggfun through a template parameter
  - what's the language construct?
* multiple stages with specific code to insert
